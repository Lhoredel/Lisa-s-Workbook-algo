# Lisa-s-Workbook-algo
This program solves the Lisa's Workbook problem by counting the number of problems that share the same number as their page number in a specially formatted workbook. The program mimics turning pages while keeping track of problem numbers, adding to the count each time a problem number equals its current page number.
